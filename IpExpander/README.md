# IpExpander
A Python script to expand a file containing IP addresses, CIDRs, and ranges to a file containing one IP address per line.

# Features
* Takes an input text file containing IP address notation and expands it into one output text file
* Open for more suggestions!
* See the following post for more information - https://www.doyler.net/security-not-included/ipexpander-netaddr

# TODO
* Add ability to expand ranges where the hyphen is in a different octet
* See how easy it would be without netaddr (less external dependencies)
* Clean up the code
